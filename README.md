# veVelo-NFT-Hunt
Finding profitable veVelo NFTs listed

This code is for scanning the Velo NFTs on [Quix](https://qx.app/) and finding locked veVelo NFts that have high enough profit margin to make sense for purchase.  You will need to install NodeJs as well as nodemon.  Other than that make sure your files look the same as mine especially the data.txt file within the same folder.  The script will write all the profitable NFT links as well as their profit margin to that file.
